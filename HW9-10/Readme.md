#Read ME

These weeks were a struggle. I could not for the life of me figure out how to display the data from the JSON sheet. I feel like I tried everything Get function, load function and pushing the data into a class. The problem was the JSON file had - all the data was within one data called Pokemon. I could figure out how to access the data within the data. I had a breakthrough when I did function pokedex.pokmon.id[0]. Then I push stuff into an array. Then append each div tag with a number and the data and a number and it worked. If could have had more time (Even though I had a ton of time) I would try making a better displacement method.



But regardless I got it done on time even though it was tough.
