I found this week to be very hard. I had trouble with lots of things. I couldn't figure out how to store raw input into a variable. The name input is still stuck in a function under a variable. But I figured out how to press a button to call a function. These functions can add text pictures and unhindered elements. 



That was another problem I could not figure out how to hide the Rogue Knight and Mage text. When you would hover over the center of the screen that text would appear. I had to use a style that display and hide elements. Then in JavaScript when the button is pressed it call a function that removed that element. I had lots of problems but I'm glad how my website turned out and I got big plans.
