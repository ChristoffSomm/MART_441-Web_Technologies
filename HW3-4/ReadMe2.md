#ReadMe Part 2 Week 4 

This week was a long week. I spend about 15 hours on this project. 
Most of my time was writing a story and I know for a fact the story has lots of spelling errors. I'm having friends look over it and fix it. I thought I found a good way to transitioning through the story. By using buttons to call a function to hides and displays elements. When these functions are called it changes the div style display from block to none. 

I found this project to be very fun. I loved the challenge JavaScript set for me and I'm glad I got to do this project, It was fun.
