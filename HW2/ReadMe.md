This weeks lesson was easy. I have a bit of experience with python. 
However, Javascript seems different. So it's going to be interesting learning this new program. 

Here are some new things I'm going to have practice. 
* Ending statements with a ; 
* Using console.log() instead of print.
* Learning the new syntax. 

Because this lesson wasn't too hard I choose to make my background a gradient. Just to give my self a new challenge and because I had a lot of free time. I tried all sorts of things but couldn't get it to work. My gradient would only be around my "Go back to the home page" button. I messed around and I looked online for a bit and I learn you needed to set up a padding height and margin for the (HTML and body). Setting that up fixed it right away.
