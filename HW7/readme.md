This week lesson was harder than usual but I did it. I had a few problems; mostly with pushing the variables into the new array. For some weird reason, the array would not accept my Image paths. So to get around it I build a pre-made array in the same order and the [Random number] will call both arrays.   

Dreamweaver wouldn't even recognize my class. I switch over to Atom where it worked fine.  

It wasn't only my image paths having trouble my 'year data' was going through the array too. I end up rewriting the code and it fixed itself. I tried everything I thought might be because I started the file in Dreamweaver. I don't know, but I got it to work.
