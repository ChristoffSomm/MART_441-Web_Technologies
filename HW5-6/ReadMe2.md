#ReadMe 2.0

This week was challenging but also fun. Working on this site I notice there are still a few bugs.

Like if your quick enough and click on another image before it disappears. You can break the code. But other than that the site turned out well. I add a counter so when an attempt is made the code adds + one. That number then gets sent through JSON and is your score at the end. Also after getting 10 matches the code automatically sends you to the last page. BUT... When you click on the second to last card you have 2 sec to click on the other one. I couldnâ€™t figure out how to make it the last card.
