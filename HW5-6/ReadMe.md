This week was hard. I couldn't figure out how to get this game to work. I tried using an if statement and a randomly generating a number then adding it to a string like this. " ./img/image" + randomNumber + ".jpg". But I couldn't figure out how to get two of the same images on the page. 

Long story short I watched the walkthrough live. I noticed the way Professor Cassens did it was 100% easier than what I was doing. I scratched the code I was working on and tried Professor Cassens way it worked way better than mine. I honestly don't think I would have gotten this assignment done without the walkthrough.  

Note - I do like the walkthrough later in the week. It allows me to struggle and maybe figure out how to build the code on my own. But if I get stuck or can't figure it out; I can watch the walkthrough video later in the week.
