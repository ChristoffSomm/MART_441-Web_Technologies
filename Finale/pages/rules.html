	<h1>How to Play</h1>
	<br>
	<p>1. The GM describes the environment. The GM
tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s
around them, presenting the basic scope of options that
present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room,
what’s on a table, who’s in the house, and so on)</p>
	<p>2. The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying,
“We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times,
different adventurers do different things: one adventurer
might search a treasure chest while a second examines
an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps
watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns,
but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.
Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer
wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM
might just say that the door opens and describe what lies
beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might
hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might
make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task.
In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often
relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of
an action.</p>
	<p>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’
actions. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back
to step 1.
This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or
locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In
certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more
structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is
fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the
adventure.
Often the action of an adventure takes place in the
imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s
verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to
use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the
mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different
voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other
characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM
might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures
to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the
players keep track of where everyone is.</p>
	
	
	<br><br>
	<h1>Game Dice</h1>
	<br>
	<p>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of
sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in
many bookstores.
In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the
letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10,
d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the
typical cube that many games use).
Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You
generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two
different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die
(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and
the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.
Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20,
and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit
from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71,
and 00 and 0 is 100.
When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many
dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to
add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eightsided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.
The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3”
and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide
the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of
1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending
on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the
die, it’s a 2.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h1>The D20</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just
bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an
outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging
river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball,
or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In
cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the
Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided
die, a d20, to determine success or failure.
Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for
most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as
1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability
modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost
every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or
monster’s behalf.
Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the
three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the
rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>
	<p>1. Roll the die and add <b>a modifier</b>. Roll a d20 and add
the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes
includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and
how to determine an ability’s modifier.)</p>
<p>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A
class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some
other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>
<p>3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total
equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a
failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target
numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,
attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.
The target number for an ability check or a saving
throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks
in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for
using the d20 in the game.</p>
