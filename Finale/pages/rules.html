	<h1>How to Play</h1>
	<br>
	<p>1. The GM describes the environment. The GM
tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s
around them, presenting the basic scope of options that
present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room,
what’s on a table, who’s in the house, and so on)</p>
	<p>2. The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying,
“We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times,
different adventurers do different things: one adventurer
might search a treasure chest while a second examines
an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps
watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns,
but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.
Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer
wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM
might just say that the door opens and describe what lies
beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might
hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might
make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task.
In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often
relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of
an action.</p>
	<p>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’
actions. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back
to step 1.
This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or
locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In
certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more
structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is
fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the
adventure.
Often the action of an adventure takes place in the
imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s
verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to
use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the
mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different
voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other
characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM
might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures
to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the
players keep track of where everyone is.</p>
	
	
	<br><br>
	<h1>Game Dice</h1>
	<br>
	<p>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of
sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in
many bookstores.
In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the
letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10,
d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the
typical cube that many games use).
Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You
generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two
different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die
(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and
the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.
Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20,
and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit
from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71,
and 00 and 0 is 100.
When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many
dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to
add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eightsided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.
The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3”
and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide
the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of
1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending
on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the
die, it’s a 2.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h1>The D20</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just
bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an
outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging
river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball,
or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In
cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the
Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided
die, a d20, to determine success or failure.
Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for
most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as
1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability
modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost
every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or
monster’s behalf.
Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the
three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the
rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>
	<p>1. Roll the die and add <b>a modifier</b>. Roll a d20 and add
the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes
includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and
how to determine an ability’s modifier.)</p>
<p>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A
class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some
other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>
<p>3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total
equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a
failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target
numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,
attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.
The target number for an ability check or a saving
throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks
in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for
using the d20 in the game.</p>
	
	<br><br>
	<h1>Round Down</h1>
	<br>
<p>There’s one more general rule you need to know at the
outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round
down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is
one-half or greater.</p>

	<br><br>
	<h1>Step-by-Step</h1>
	<br>
	
	
	<p>Your first step in playing an adventurer in the
Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a
character of your own. Your character is a combination
of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. 
You choose a nation (such as the fire nation or water nation) 
and decide if your a bender or chi blocker.  You also invent the
personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. </p>
	
	<br><br>
	<h1>1. Choose a Nation</h1>
	<br>
	
	<p>Every character belongs to a nation. There are four nations set in 
		the world of Tabletop Avatar. Choose one</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Air Nation</h3>
	<p>The Air Nation were the collective of the airbender people. Though the people of this nation were nomadic, the Air Nation raised children and situated their central governments in four monastic temples located at various ends of the globe, two for males and two for females. The four air temples are located on small archipelagos that were Air Nation land on the tip of mountains and, in one case, hanging under cliffs. The Air Nation were loosely run by elder councils, one male and one female. Each council was run by a head monk or head nun. <a href="airbenders.html">Read More...</a> <br><br>  Character belonging  to the Air Nation are generally peaceful, open-minded and extremely spiritual.</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Earth Nation</h3>
	<p>The Earth Kingdom is the largest and most diverse of the four nations, comprised of a massive continent in the eastern hemisphere and several islands. The nation's people are strong and proud, with some of them being earthbenders. The Earth Kingdom is extremely diverse, having mountainous, forested, grassland, desert, and man-conquered areas, including the vast megacity of Ba Sing Se. Due to its peoples' bending ability, the people of the Earth Kingdom have created magnificent structures out of stone.<a href="earthbenders.html">Read More...</a> <br><br>  Character belonging  to the Earth Nation are generally stubborn, strong and extremely proud.</p>
	
	
	<br>
	<h3>Fire Nation</h3>
	<p>The Fire Nation is the second largest nation and home to both firebenders and nonbenders alike, though firebenders were sometimes held in higher respect than nonbenders. It is located on an archipelago of islands located in the western hemisphere of the planet and is the most advanced of the four nations, with steam and gas power. The Fire Nation is also diverse in landscape, featuring many volcanic islands in its archipelago and on the mainland, as well as a tropical climate. It also has the world's most popular vacation spot, Ember Island.<a href="firebenders.html">Read More...</a> <br><br>  Character belonging  to the Fire Nation are generally hot-headed, temperamental and powerful.</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Water Nation</h3>
	<p>The Water Tribe is a sovereignty of waterbenders and nonbenders. There are three tribes: the Northern Water Tribe, centered in the North Pole; the Southern Water Tribe, centered in the South Pole; and the Foggy Swamp Tribe, located in the Earth Kingdom's Foggy Swamp. Both the Northern and Southern Water Tribes are chiefdoms led by a tribal chief. Historically, the Northern Water Tribe has maintained a stronger position than its Southern counterpart, in part due to its large bending population. <a href="waterbenders.html">Read More...</a> <br><br>  Character belonging  to the Water Nation are generally observing, graceful and acting in concert with the environment.</p>
	
	
	
	<br><br>
	<h1>2. Choose a skill</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Every adventurer has a skill. A skill broadly
	describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he
	or she possesses. Choose One</p>	
	
	<br>
	<h3>Bending arts</h3>
	<p>Bending is the ability to manipulate an element and is significant to many aspects of life in the World of Avatar. There are four known bending arts; Air, Earth, Fire and Water (Choose One). Typically benders align with their nation, however, benders with mixed parents can have diffrent bending arts and live in different nations. (ex. Having the same parents, Mako is a Firebender and Bolin is an Earthbender)</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Chi Blocking</h3>
	<p>Coming Soon</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Energybending</h3>
	<p>Coming Soon</p>

	<h3>Avatar</h3>
	<p>Coming Soon</p>
	
	<br><br>
	<h1>3. Leveling</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in
	level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). However a 
	GM may want a character start at a certain level. Here is a leveling progression chart</p>

	<h1>4. Determine Ability Scores</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Much of what your character does in the game depends
on his or her six abilities: <b>Strength</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>, <b>Constitution</b>, <b>Intelligence</b>, <b>Wisdom</b>, and <b>Charisma</b>. Each abilityhas a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>
	<p>You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the
highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five
more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to
save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining
ability scores, you can use the following scores instead:
15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>
	<p>Now take your six numbers and write each number
beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign
scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma. </p>
	<p><b>Note: Abilities will effect your skills. Here is a chart to help determine where your highest abilities should go.</b></p>
	<p>Airbenders - Wisdom<br>
	Earthbenders - Strength<br>
	Firebenders - Charisma<br>
	Waterbenders - Intelligence<br><br>
	Energybenders - Constitution<br>
	Chi Blocker - Dexterity<br>
	Avatar - Uses all abilities</p><br>
	<h3>Ability Modifier</h3>
	<p>After assigning your ability scores, determine your
ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers
table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting
the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide
the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to
each of your scores.</p>

	<h1>5.  Describe Your Character</h1>
	<br>	
	<p>Once you know the basic game aspects of your character,
it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about
what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.</p>
